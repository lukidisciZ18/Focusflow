# FocusFlow Deployment Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Deployment Path

### For Local Development:
```bash
./quick-deploy.sh
```

### For Production Deployment:
1. **Frontend**: Use Vercel (`./deploy-options.sh vercel`)
2. **Backend**: Use Railway (`./deploy-options.sh railway`)
3. **Database**: Use MongoDB Atlas (free tier)

## ðŸ”§ What's Fixed

I also fixed a syntax error in your `app.js` file where there was a missing comma in the fetch request headers.

##  Ready to Deploy!

You can now:

1. **Start local development immediately:**
   ```bash
   ./quick-deploy.sh
   ```

2. **Explore all deployment options:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-options.sh help
   ```

3. **Deploy to cloud platforms:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy-options.sh vercel    # Frontend
   ./deploy-options.sh railway   # Backend
   ```

The deployment setup is now comprehensive and handles all the common scenarios you'll encounter. The scripts include error handling, prerequisites checking, and clear instructions for each deployment option.

Would you like me to help you with any specific deployment scenario or test the current setup?
